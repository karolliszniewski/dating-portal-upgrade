1. Wants whole site - easy to navigate - should be direct - sign up here - fill out profile - start browsing profiles
- Registration is in the hero section. After registering, users are redirected to the Edit Profile page. A modal appears asking them to confirm they are 18 or older. If they do not accept, they will be logged out. If they try to leave the form without filling it out, a red error message will appear at the top of the screen and they will be redirected back to the form. After completing the form, they will be taken to the Near Me page

2. when logged in- edit cover photo- atm automatically goes to own profile- no instruction on what to do- so wants to push the person straight away- when logging into account just goes to own profile but would prefer if other peoples content showed up so can start interacting with.
- It will land on the Near Me page after the account setup

4. section' whats new cliff'- he doesn't want this like fb as if hes going to post comments etc- this is 1 to 1 so people only chatting amongst themselves.
I changed the position of the element, so the feed is no longer visible on the profile
