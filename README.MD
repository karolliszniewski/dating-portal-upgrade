- Registration is in the hero section. After registering, users are redirected to the Edit Profile page. A modal appears asking them to confirm they are 18 or older. If they do not accept, they will be logged out. If they try to leave the form without filling it out, a red error message will appear at the top of the screen and they will be redirected back to the form. After completing the form, they will be taken to the Near Me page
